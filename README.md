Industrial Visit Form - PHP Project

Hey! I built a student registration form using PHP + MySQL. You can clone the code from my GitHub and run it on your own PC using XAMPP. Just follow the instructions in this file!

This is a simple PHP and MySQL based project I made to collect details of students for an industrial visit.

-------------------------------------------------------

What it does:

- Collects name, email, phone, etc. through a form
- Saves the data to a MySQL database
- Shows a thank you page after submission

-------------------------------------------------------

Tech Used:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PHP for backend
- MySQL for database
- XAMPP to run locally

-------------------------------------------------------

Files included:

- index.php – the main form
- style.css – styles for the form
- index.js – JavaScript
- thankyou.html – message page
- 127_0_0_1.sql – for database import
- Some other PHP files I made for practice

-------------------------------------------------------

How to Use:

- Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP
- Put this folder inside htdocs (like: C:\xampp\htdocs\cwh)
- Import the .sql file into phpMyAdmin
- Open your browser and visit the project folder through localhost
- Fill the form and check your database

-------------------------------------------------------

How to Run This Project (Simple Steps):

This project runs using XAMPP, since it's made with PHP and MySQL.

Step 1: Install XAMPP from the official website  
         (We need both Apache and MySQL)

Step 2: Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL

Step 3: Put this project folder into:  
         C:\xampp\htdocs\php-project-  
         (You can rename the folder if needed)

Step 4: Open your browser and go to phpMyAdmin  
         (Usually available at localhost/phpmyadmin)

Step 5: Click Import and upload the file named: 127_0_0_1.sql  
         (This will create the database)

Step 6: Visit your project folder in the browser using localhost  
         (Make sure Apache is still running)
         
Now you can fill the form and data will be saved to the MySQL database.
