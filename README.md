Industrial Visit Form - PHP Project

Hey! I built a student registration form using PHP + MySQL. You can clone the code from my GitHub and run it on your own PC using XAMPP. Just follow the instructions in this file!

This is a simple PHP and MySQL based project I made to collect details of students for an industrial visit.

-------------------------------------------------------

What it does:

- Collects name, email, phone, etc. through a form
- Saves the data to a MySQL database
- Shows a thank you page after submission

-------------------------------------------------------

Tech Used:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PHP for backend
- MySQL for database
- XAMPP to run locally

-------------------------------------------------------

Files included:

- index.php – the main form
- style.css – styles for the form
- index.js – JavaScript
- thankyou.html – message page
- 127_0_0_1.sql – for database import
- Some other PHP files I made for practice

-------------------------------------------------------

How to Use:

1. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP
2. Put this folder in htdocs (like: C:\xampp\htdocs\cwh)
3. Import the .sql file into phpMyAdmin
4. Open browser and go to: http://localhost/cwh/index.php
5. Fill the form and check your database

-------------------------------------------------------

How to Run This Project (Simple Steps):

This project runs using XAMPP, since it's made with PHP and MySQL.

Step 1: Install XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/  
         (We need Apache and MySQL both)

Step 2: Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL

Step 3: Put this project folder in:
         C:\xampp\htdocs\php-project-  
         (you can rename the folder if needed)

Step 4: Open browser and go to:
         http://localhost/phpmyadmin

Step 5: Click Import and upload the file: 127_0_0_1.sql  
         (This creates the database)

Step 6: Open browser and go to:
         http://localhost/php-project-/index.php  
         (The form will open)

Now you can fill the form and data will be saved to the MySQL database.
