# Industrial Visit Form - PHP Project

This is a simple PHP and MySQL based project I made to collect details of students for an industrial visit.

## What it does:

- Collects name, email, phone, etc. through a form
- Saves the data to a MySQL database
- Shows a thank you page after submission

## Tech Used:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PHP for backend
- MySQL for database
- XAMPP to run locally

## How to use:

1. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP
2. Put this folder in htdocs (like: `htdocs/cwh`)
3. Import the `.sql` file into phpMyAdmin
4. Open browser and go to: `http://localhost/cwh/index.php`
5. Fill the form and check your database

## Files included:

- `index.php` – the main form
- `style.css` – styles for the form
- `index.js` – JavaScript
- `thankyou.html` – message page
- `.sql` file – for database import
- Some other PHP files I made for practice
